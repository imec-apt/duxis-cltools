# duxis-cltools - Changelog

## 1.0.0
- Add support for `FROM node` declarations in _Dockerfile.template_ files with insertion of Node.js
  version declared as `nodeVersion` property in the project _package.json_ file.
- No longer expect a trailing slash for _DX\_HUB_ values.
- Use `imec` as default value for _DX\_HUB_. This new prefix should be used for Duxis Foundation
  v1.14.0 and up. For services that reference a prefixed Duxis Foundation image in the _dx.base.yml_
  Docker Composer file, e.g. `image: ${DX_HUB}/duxis-auth-store:${DX_VERSION}`, you should override
  this reference with an un-prefixed one -e.g. `image: duxis-auth-store:${DX_VERSION}`- in the
  _dc.dxdev.yml_ file.
